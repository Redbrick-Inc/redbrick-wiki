# Tips & Tricks

<Steps>

### Save Your Work as a File Whenever You Make Important Changes

<Callout type="error">
  _To avoid losing your project and to keep track of your progress, it is
  recommended to save as a file every time you make significant changes. Keep
  these files locally on your computer._
  <br />
  <center>![파일 열기](../../../images/save_to_file1.png) Save as file</center>
</Callout>

<Callout type="information">

- This way, you can easily access previous versions and recover old code if needed.

- This is especially important if your internet connection is unstable.

### Please Use Assets from the Studio Asset Library

_To prevent lag and potential issues, it is recommended to use assets from the studio asset library. Using damaged or corrupted 3D assets can cause problems and may break your project._

<Callout>

Therefore, please use assets from the studio asset library or lightweight and simple 3D assets whenever possible.

### Animation Tricks

_To achieve high-quality results, it is better to use Tween for smooth animations._

```js showLineNumbers filename="Animation"
const start = { y: 0 }; // Initial Y position
const end = { y: 2 }; // Final Y position

const tween = new TWEEN.Tween(start)
    .to(end, 100) // Set duration
    .onUpdate(() => {
        object.position.y = start.y; // Update object's Y position
    })
    .easing(TWEEN.Easing.Quadratic.InOut) // Apply easing for smooth transitions
    .repeat(Infinity) // Repeat indefinitely
    .yoyo(true); // Reverse animation on each cycle
    .start(); // Initiate the animation
```

### Camera Movement Change in Edit Mode

If you find the default orbit camera movement difficult to control, press the `9` key to switch it.

<Callout type="warning">
  Please note that if you press `9` again, the camera will move slowly. You can
  press it once more to return to normal speed.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Additionally, if you press `Shift` while moving the camera, you can speed up
  its movement.
</Callout>
