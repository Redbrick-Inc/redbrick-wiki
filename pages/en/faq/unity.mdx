### üîë  Final Notes

<Callout type="warning">
  1. If <span style={{ color: 'white' }}>**Compression Format**</span> is disabled, the WebGL file does not appear, so you need to change it to <span style={{ color: 'white' }}>**Brotli**</span>.
  2. Ensure that <span style={{ color: 'white' }}>**Decompression Fallback**</span> is enabled in <span style={{ color: 'white' }}>**Player Settings**</span> to
  make sure your WebGL build works smoothly online.
