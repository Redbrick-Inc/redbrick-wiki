### Access to Old Code

There is no version control system like Git to record changes in code.
If you want to preserve the existing code before making changes, comment out the existing code or save the project as a file.

```js showLineNumbers filename="You can comment out the existing code and add new code."
// comment out the existing code
// const score_board = GUI.getObject("score_board1");
// score_board.setText("100");


// new code
const score_board = GUI.getObject("score_board2");
score_board.setText("200");
```
