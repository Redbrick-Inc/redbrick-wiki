_To effectively use the AI Assistant (GPT), it's crucial to ask clear and
specific questions. Providing context, background information, and sample code
where applicable can greatly improve the quality of the response. Here's a

  Sometimes, GPT's reply might not be perfect.It's important for users to
  understand which parts of GPT's reply are usable and which are not.

1.  Ask Clear and Specific Questions: The more specific your question, the more precise the answer will be. Ambiguous questions can lead to broad or unrelated answers.

    - Example: Instead of asking, "How do I fix this code?", you could ask, "How can I resolve the `SyntaxError` in this code?"

2.  Provide Context and Background Information: Explain the problem or topic in detail, including any relevant background information. This helps the assistant understand your needs better.

    - Example: "I'm creating a timer GUI. How can I count the time using setInterval and display it on the timer GUI?"

3.  Include Sample Code When Possible: If your question involves code, including a snippet can help the assistant provide a more accurate and relevant answer.

    - Example: "Can you help me to refractor this part? [Add code]"
