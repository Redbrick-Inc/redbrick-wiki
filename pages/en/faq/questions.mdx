### How do I create a retry button?

Create initialization function, where you put all of your intializion code whenever game starts. And use it whenever you want to restart the game.

```js showLineNumbers filename="example restart" {5, 7-12, 18-20}
let score = 0;
const scoreGUI = GUI.getObject("score_gui");

const startButton = GUI.getObject("start_button");
const restartButton = GUI.getObject("restart_button");

function gameStart() {
  PLAYER.spawn();
  score = 0;
  scoreGUI.setText = score;
  // other parts that needs to be initialized/set
}

startButton.onClick(() => {
  gameStart(); //start
});

restartButton.onClick(() => {
  gameStart(); //restart all values
});
```

### Why isn't my object moving?

<Callout type="info">
  Use `body.needUpdate` to update the Physics body when it's **turned on**.
  Update it everytime whenever object body position is changed.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">
  You don't need to do this if the Physics body is **turned off**.
</Callout>

```js showLineNumbers {9}
const trash = WORLD.getObject("trash");

function Start() {
  trash.onCollide(avatar, handleTrashCollision);
}

function Update(dt) {
  if (trash.body) {
    trash.body.needUpdate = true;
  }
}
```

### How do I change the background color?

Changing the background color in your project can be easily accomplished using the `WORLD.background` property and the `THREE.Color()` function from [Three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=color#api/en/math/Color). Below are various methods you can use to specify colors.

<Callout type="info">
  Choose one of the methods listed below to set your background color.
</Callout>

```js showLineNumbers filename="Background change"
//Hexadecimal color (recommended)
WORLD.background = new THREE.Color(0xff0000);

//RGB string
WORLD.background = new THREE.Color("rgb(255, 0, 0)");
WORLD.background = new THREE.Color("rgb(100%, 0%, 0%)");

//X11 color name - all 140 color names are supported.
//Note the lack of CamelCase in the name
WORLD.background = new THREE.Color("skyblue");

//HSL string
WORLD.background = new THREE.Color("hsl(0, 100%, 50%)");

//Separate RGB values between 0 and 1
WORLD.background = new THREE.Color(1, 0, 0);
```

### How do I change the avatar's jump height?

To change the jump height of the avatar or player, use `PLAYER.changePlayerJumpHeight(3)`. The default jump height is set to 3.

### How do I switch to first-person view?

### What does this error mean?

- **TypeError**: This error occurs when an operation is performed on a value of an inappropriate type. For example, if you try to perform a mathematical operation on a string instead of a number, you'll get a `TypeError`.

- **SyntaxError**: This error occurs when the code contains invalid syntax. It means there is a mistake in the code structure, such as missing parentheses, unmatched braces, or incorrect indentation, preventing the code from being parsed correctly.

### How do I move the avatar?

If you want the avatar to move along with moving objects it steps on, you can use the function `.changeAxisSpeed(x, y, z)`. This function allows you to set the movement speed for the avatar along the x, y, and z axes.

### Why isn't my camera properties change working?

Updates the camera projection matrix. Must be called after any change of parameters (`.fov`, `.far`, `.near`).

### How Do I Change the Camera?

To switch from Camera 1 to Camera 2, simply use the command `camera2.activate()`. If you want to switch to a different camera, use `otherCamera.activate()`.

### How can I display only text?
