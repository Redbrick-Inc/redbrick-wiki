# Content type

> Provides information about content types.

Before starting a project, you can choose the type of content you want to create. There are three different content types available:

1. **Metaverse**: In this mode, the camera and avatar are set by default. The avatar uses the one set on the Redbrick website, and the camera is configured to always follow the avatar.

2. **Game**: In this mode, the avatar is optional. Users can decide whether to use an avatar and whether the camera should follow the avatar. This option offers high flexibility.

<Callout type="info">
  This mode does not have predefined settings for the camera and avatar. Therefore, users must configure these settings themselves.
</Callout>

3. **VR**: This mode supports virtual reality. If you choose the Metaverse and enable VR, the VR camera will be linked to the avatar. In Game mode, the placement of the VR camera can be set according to the user's preference.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you choose a content type and later decide to change it during development,
  there is no need to worry. You can easily change the preset script at any time
  based on your preference.
</Callout>

## Metaverse

In order to get started with the `metaverse`, please select the `metaverse` option before creating a template.

This preset script creates an avatar, a camera, and attaches the camera to the avatar to enable a following effect.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  You don't have to code this. If you selected `metaverse`, this code will be
  there by default.
</Callout>

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="PresetScript"
const avatar = REDBRICK.AvatarManager.createDefaultAvatar();
const camera = WORLD.getObject("MainCamera");
const followingCamera = avatar.setFollowingCamera(camera);
avatar.setDefaultController();
```

## Game

In the `game` template, there is no code that creates an avatar.

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="PresetScript" {2}
function Start() {
  //nothing
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **However:** If you want to create an avatar, you can add avatar creation code
  as seen in the `metaverse` template.
</Callout>

## VR Option

You can toggle the "VR option" while creating a template in order to use it. This will automatically add additional code to `PresetScript`, so you don't have to manually do so.

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="PresetScript"
const avatar = REDBRICK.AvatarManager.createDefaultAvatar();
const camera = WORLD.getObject("MainCamera");
const followingCamera = avatar.setFollowingCamera(camera);
avatar.setDefaultController();
followingCamera.useVR({ VRObject: avatar }); //VR needs to have VRObject
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **NOTE**: VR functionality is compatible exclusively with `perspective`
  cameras.
</Callout>

Additionally, VR can be used with other VRObjects too.

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="VRObject" {3}
const headOfSomething = WORLD.getObject("headOfSomething");
const camera = WORLD.getObject("cameraTitle");
camera.useVR({ VRObject: headOfSomething }); // now you can use VR without an avatar
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **NOTE**: Currently, VR does not render GUIs, so please keep this in mind.
</Callout>

If you choose a game mode and VR settings, the PresetScript might look like this. However, you can customize it as in the previous example (headOfSomething).

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="VR GAME PresetScript"
const camera = WORLD.getObject("MainCamera");
if (!camera) return;
const obj = new THREE.Object3D();
WORLD.add(obj);
obj.position.copy(camera.position);
camera.useVR({ VRObject: obj });
```
