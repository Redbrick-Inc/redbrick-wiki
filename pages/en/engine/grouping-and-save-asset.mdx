# Grouping Objects and Save as Asset

> Group objects and save the grouped objects as assets.

---

<Callout type="default"> 
  **GUI Objects** cannot be grouped.  
  While it's possible to save them as assets, they will become empty objects upon saving, making them unusable.
  Therefore, please note that **only 3D objects can be grouped and saved** at this time. 
</Callout>
<br/>

### Grouping Objects
<Callout type="error"> 
  If the object is a collider but needs to be moved, ensure that **CanCollide** is **ON** before grouping.  
  If the objects are grouped without this setting, you’ll need to set both **CanCollide** and **Static** to **ON** in the collision settings.
  Doing so will cause issues if the object is moved through code, as the position of the collider will not update. 
</Callout>

To group objects, select the objects you want to group in the Scene View by holding down the `Ctrl` key.  
Once all the objects are selected, press `Ctrl + G` to group them together.

### Save as Asset

You can save both grouped objects and individual objects in the Scene View as assets.

<Steps> 
  ### Renaming Grouped Objects (Optional)

  When saving as an asset, you’ll be asked to set the asset's name. It's a good idea to rename the object to something more recognizable for your project.

  ### Taking a Screenshot of the Object to Save

  Take a screenshot of the object you want to save.  
  On Windows, use `Win + Shift + S`. On macOS, use `Cmd + Shift + 4` to capture the screenshot.

  ### Saving the Selected Object as an Asset

  Select the object you want to save, either from the Explorer or the Scene View, and click on the Menu in the top left, then choose **Save as Asset**.

  ### Checking the Saved Asset

  You can view the saved asset in the **My Asset** section in the top left. The most recently added assets will appear at the bottom.

  ### Using the Saved Asset

  To use the saved asset, click on it or drag it from **My Asset** into the Scene View.  
  For colliders, remember to set **CanCollide** to **ON**.
