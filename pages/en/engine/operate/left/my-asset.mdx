You can add uploaded items to the scene in two ways:  
Add as a 3D Object to the scene or add as a GUI Object to the scene.  
For the differences between 3D objects and GUI objects, refer to [this guide](../../../script/start/3d-and-gui-object#differences-between-3d-objects-and-gui-objects).

### Adding to the Scene as a 3D Object

Click the item or drag and drop it into the scene to add it as a 3D object, making it a child of the WORLD.
