> This provides information on asset replacement.

### Asset Types

Assets are broadly classified into two types.

1. **3D Objects**: Objects such as Camera, Spawn, Light, Effect, Mesh, Sound, and Video belong to this category. 
<br/>They have Transform properties including position, rotation, and scale.

2. **GUI Objects**: GUI objects belong to this category. 
<br/>They have Transform properties including center, anchor, offset, and size.

<Callout type="error">
    You cannot replace objects of different types.
    <br/>Currently, Sound and Video cannot be replaced with any other types of assets. This will be added in the future.
</Callout>
