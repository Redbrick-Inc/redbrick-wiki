# Saving Data to Local Storage

You can store data in the user's local storage (browser) to keep simple game records, for example.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="save-local-storage"
const save_btn = GUI.getObject("save_btn");
let score = 100;

save_btn.onClick(function() {
    localStorage.setItem('game_score', score);
});
```

You can retrieve data stored in local storage like this  

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="load-game-data"
let score = localStorage.getItem("game_score");
```

    However, keep in mind that local storage can be accessed easily by users through developer tools, so it's not suitable for storing important or sensitive data.
    Additionally, if users delete site data from their browser, data stored in local storage will also be deleted.
