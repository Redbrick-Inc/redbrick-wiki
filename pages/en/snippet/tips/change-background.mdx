### Write the Script

In this snippet, we will create a logic to change the background image when a specific object is touched.
To do this, place an object in the scene for collision detection and write the code to change the background image.

<Callout type="warning">
  To use `onCollide()`, you need to check the Body in the object's property panel.
  <center>![snippet_physics-body](/images/snippet/snippet_physics-body.png) Physics > Body</center>
</Callout>

```js showLineNumbers copy
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");

obj.onCollide(PLAYER, function() {
    const newBackground = GUI.getObject("background_IMG").material.map; // Load the background image map
    newBackground.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    newBackground.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
    newBackground.mapping = THREE.EquirectangularReflectionMapping;
    newBackground.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding;
    newBackground.repeat.set(1, 1);
    WORLD.background = newBackground; // Set the new background
})
```

### Interact with the Object in the Game

When you run the game and interact with the object, the background image will change.
