# Debugging

There are several ways to find an error.

<Steps>

### Console

If something isn't working, you can start by using `console.log()` to log something in the console. To open the console, you can press `F12` to see it.

<Tabs items={["example 1", "example 2"]} defaultIndex="0">

    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```js showLineNumbers copy {6}
        let sum = 0;

        //sum until 25
        for (let i = 1; i <= 25; i++) {
        sum += i;
        console.log(`sum = ${sum}, i = ${i}`);
        }

        ```

        <br />
        <center>![](../../../images/example-console.png) Console result </center>

    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>

    You can also check objects and their properties. Here is an example to illustrate this further.

     ```js showLineNumbers copy {6}
        const item = WORLD.getOjbect("item");

        console.log(item);

        ```

        <br />
        <center>![](../../../images/example-console2.png) Console result </center>
    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

### Save and Reopen project

If you believe everything is fine and you are unable to find any errors, please attempt to save the file by using the "save to file" option.

Afterwards, create a new project and open it using the "open from file".

Finally, try playing the project again to check if the issue has been resolved.
