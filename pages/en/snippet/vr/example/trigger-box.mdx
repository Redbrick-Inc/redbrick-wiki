# Play video using Trigger Box

> Let's create an event where the video plays when we move to a specific location.

<img
  src="/images/snippet/vr/example/trigger-box/trigger-box.gif"
  alt="trigger-box"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
/>
<br />

Above is the result of completion. Once the player reaches the box, the video will play and the box will disappear.

<Steps>
    ### To add a video

    Let's bring a video provided by Redbrick Studio and place it.
    <br/>
    <center>![trigger_box_1](/images/snippet/vr/example/trigger-box/trigger_box_1.png) </center>

    ### Create Trigger Box

    Bring and place a cube provided by Redbrick Studio. <br/>
    Material > Opacity (2nd) Use the value to adjust the transparency. <br/>
    To have a collision event with a player, **Behavior > Body (3rd) is Setting to On**.
    <br/>
    <center>![trigger_box_2](/images/snippet/vr/example/trigger-box/trigger_box_2.png) </center>
    <br/>

    ### Write the Script Below

    At this time, you need to change the video and box object name produced above by referring to the script below.<br/>

    ``` js showLineNumbers
    // VR Option Setting
    const avatar = REDBRICK.AvatarManager.createDefaultAvatar();
    const camera = WORLD.getObject("MainCamera");
    const followingCamera = avatar.setFollowingCamera(camera);
    avatar.setDefaultController();
    followingCamera.useVR({VRObject: avatar});

    const video = WORLD.getObject("video");
    const TriggerBox = WORLD.getObject("TriggerBox");

    function Start() {
        // When a player collision into a box
        TriggerBox.onCollide(PLAYER, () => {
            video.play();
            TriggerBox.kill(); // delete box
        });
        video.pause(); // When start, stop the video
    }
    ```

    ### Run the Test

    If you test it later, you can see that it works like the first screen. <br/>
    Currently, we have not completely lowered transparency for distinction, but if you make it completely transparent, you can use it as a **trigger to cause an event when player pass somewhere**.
