<br/>

Above is the result of completion. If you click on the same figure, it will fill in, and if it is incorrect, you will see the puzzle running again.

<Steps>
    ### Add puzzle objects to click

    Use the Redbrick Studio Asset to add 3 shapes of objects. <br/>
    These objects are the shapes that the player will choose to solve the puzzle.

    ### Add answer puzzle objects

    Copy the previously added object to adjust the position, color, and transparency. <br/>
    **Material > Opacity (2nd)** Use the value to adjust the transparency. <br/>
    These objects are the answers to the puzzle shapes selected by the player.

    ### Write the Script Below

    At this time, you need to change objects name produced above by referring to the script below. <br/>
    In the script below, we named the objects (blue) to click on as puzzle ~. <br/>
    In the script below, we named the objects (pink) to be answered as answer ~. <br/>

    ``` js showLineNumbers
    // VR Option Setting
    const avatar = REDBRICK.AvatarManager.createDefaultAvatar();
    const camera = WORLD.getObject("MainCamera");
    const followingCamera = avatar.setFollowingCamera(camera);
    avatar.setDefaultController();
    followingCamera.useVR({VRObject: avatar});

    const puzzleBox = WORLD.getObject("puzzleBox");
    const answerBox = WORLD.getObject("answerBox");
    const puzzleCylinder = WORLD.getObject("puzzleCylinder");
    const answerCylinder = WORLD.getObject("answerCylinder");
    const puzzleEllipse = WORLD.getObject("puzzleEllipse");
    const answerEllipse = WORLD.getObject("answerEllipse");

    let currentPuzzleNum = 0; // The value of the puzzle player is currently holding
    let currentPuzzle = null; // The puzzle object player is currently holding

    let puzzles = [];
    let answers = [];

    function Start() {
        // puzzles, answers place the same order of shapes in the array.
        puzzles.push(puzzleBox); // 1
        puzzles.push(puzzleCylinder); // 2
        puzzles.push(puzzleEllipse); // 3
        
        answers.push(answerBox); // 1
        answers.push(answerCylinder); // 2
        answers.push(answerEllipse); // 3
        
        answers.forEach((puzzle, index) => {
            puzzle.onClick(() => {
                // If player chose the right puzzle
                if(currentPuzzle !== null && currentPuzzleNum == index){
                    // Move it to the right pos
                    currentPuzzle.position.set(puzzle.position.x, puzzle.position.y, puzzle.position.z);
                    currentPuzzle.revive();
                    // Reset the value of the puzzle and the object player is currently holding.
                    currentPuzzle = null;
                    currentPuzzleNum = -1;
                }else{
                    // If player chose the incorrect puzzle
                    if(currentPuzzle !== null){
                        // Put down the puzzle that player is currently holding again.
                        currentPuzzle.revive();
                        // Reset the value of the puzzle and the object player is currently holding.
                        currentPuzzleNum = -1;
                        currentPuzzle = null;   
                    }
                }
            });
        });
        
        puzzles.forEach((puzzle, index) => {
            // If player click on the puzzle
            puzzle.onClick(() => {
                // save current puzzle value
                currentPuzzleNum = index;
                currentPuzzle = puzzle;
                puzzle.kill();
            });
        });
    }
    ```

    ### Run the Test

    If you test it later, you can see that it works like the first screen. <br/>
    You can use the examples above to create a cube game, etc. as below. <br/>
