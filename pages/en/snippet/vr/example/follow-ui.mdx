# UI that follows the camera

> Let's use a 3D sprite object instead of a GUI to display information, and make it always face the player, no matter which direction the player moves.

<img
  src="/images/snippet/vr/example/follow-ui/follow-img.gif"
  alt="follow-img"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
/>
<br />

The image above shows the completed result. <br/>
You can see that the UI object continuously rotates to face the player, no matter which direction the player moves.

<Steps>
    ### Add the UI Object to Display

    If you press the **My Asset button(1st)** and the **Upload button(2nd)** to get the desired image and click it(3rd),
    you can see that the image has entered the object as shown in the screen below.
    <br/>
    <center>![follow-ui_1](/images/snippet/vr/example/follow-ui/follow-ui_1.png) </center>

    ### Adjust Size and Position

    Adjust the appropriate size and position as shown in the picture below.
    <br/>
    <center>![follow-ui_2](/images/snippet/vr/example/follow-ui/follow-ui_2.png) </center>
    <br/>

    ### Write the Script Below

    At this time, you need to change the UI object name produced above by referring to the script below. <br/>

    ``` js showLineNumbers
    // VR Option Setting
    const avatar = REDBRICK.AvatarManager.createDefaultAvatar();
    const camera = WORLD.getObject("MainCamera");
    const followingCamera = avatar.setFollowingCamera(camera);
    avatar.setDefaultController();
    followingCamera.useVR({VRObject: avatar});

    // Import UI Object
    const followUI = WORLD.getObject("followUI");

    function Update(dt) {
      // Set to look at the player
      followUI.lookAt(avatar.position.x, avatar.position.y, avatar.position.z);
    }
    ```

    You can see that the followUI updates to look at avatar through the lookAt function. <br/>
    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      However, `followUI.lookAt(camera.position.x, camera.position.y, camera.position.z)` in this case, it doesn't work properly in VR, so you need to point it towards your avatar.
    </Callout>

    ### Run the Test

    If you test it later, you can see that it works like the first screen.

</Steps>
