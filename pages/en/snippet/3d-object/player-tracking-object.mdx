Hereâ€™s how to implement the desired functionality.  

```js showLineNumbers copy
const vehicle = WORLD.getObject("vehicle"); // Retrieve the object that will track the player.

function Update(dt) {
  // Get the current position of the player and the object.
  const playerPosition = PLAYER.position;
  const objPosition = vehicle.position;

  // Calculate the direction for the object to move towards the player.
  const direction = new THREE.Vector3(
    playerPosition.x - objPosition.x,
    playerPosition.y - objPosition.y,
    playerPosition.z - objPosition.z
  ).normalize();

  // Set the speed of the object.
  const speed = 8; // Set the desired speed.

  // Update the position of the object.
  vehicle.position.set(
    objPosition.x + direction.x * speed * dt,
    objPosition.y + direction.y * speed * dt,
    objPosition.z + direction.z * speed * dt
  );
  
  // Make the object look at the player.
  vehicle.lookAt(PLAYER.position);
}
```
