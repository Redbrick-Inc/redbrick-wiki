# How to use Repeated Statements

> Describes how JavaScript uses repetitive statements.

In JavaScript, you can use repetitive statements such as for, for ... in, for ... of statements, and so on. This page describes loops using the most basic for.

By default, for blocks require three expressions.

- Expressions performed before repeated execution
- Expression for the conditions under which the iteration statement code is executed
- Expression after executing the iteration statement code

You can create a repeat statement using the following three expressions.

```js
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
// code block to be executed
}
```

For example, you can use the following basic iterations.

```js showLineNumbers copy
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log("Current i: ", i);
}
```

In this case, assign a variable called i to zero before executing the iteration statement, and increase the value of i by 1 for each code run. Repeat this operation only if i is less than 10.

For more repeat statements, you can refer to the following documents.
