w# THREE

> A JavaScript library used by web browsers to implement three-dimensional graphics.

Redbrick Studio is built on top of THREE, and you can access THREE and use the same features from within your scripts. By using the properties and functions of the THREE classes in addition to the additional features provided through the API, you will be able to create 3D spaces more freely and write more complete scripts.

> The following pages are excerpts from the official three.js documentation. The most commonly used properties and methods are described, and you can refer to the original documentation if you want to learn more.
