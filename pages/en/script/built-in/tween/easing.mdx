# Introducing Tween Easing function

> This provides information on various interpolation equations of tween easing functions.

---

You can change the equation for interpolating between the starting value and the target value using `.easing()`.
The default value is `TWEEN.Easing.Linear.None`. Below is an example of usage.
``` js showLineNumbers copy {6}
const startPosition = new THREE.Vector3();
const endPosition = new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0);

const tween = new TWEEN.Tween(startPosition);
tween.to(endPosition);
tween.easing(TWEEN.Easing.Quadratic.In);
tween.start();
```
