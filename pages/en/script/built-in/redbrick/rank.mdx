<Callout type="info">
  Currently, there is only one type of ranking UI, but more will be added in the future.
</Callout>

## Methods

### `.saveScore(score)`

Saves the player's score to the server.

<Callout type="warning">
    The score is saved as an **Integer**, so when designing the score system, ensure it is calculated as an **Integer**.
</Callout>

### `.show()`

Shows the ranking in **descending order (from highest score to lowest)**. The current player's score is shown at the top of the leaderboard.

### `.hide()`

Hides the ranking. Once the ranking is shown, other GUIs cannot be clicked until it is closed by pressing the close (X) button. You can use `setTimeout()` to automatically hide the ranking after a few seconds if desired.

## Example

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="rank-button" {3}
// This Button shows the ranking
this.onClick(() => {
    REDBRICK.Rank.show();
});
```

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="game-manager" {4}
// This Function saves the score as Integer.
function onGameEnd() {
    // ...
    REDBRICK.Rank.saveScore(score);
}
```

<br/>
You can use `.hide()` as follows

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="rank-button_auto-hide" {3,5}
// This Button shows the ranking and hides after 1 sec
this.onClick(() => {
    REDBRICK.Rank.show();
    setTimeout(() => {
        REDBRICK.Rank.hide();
    }, 1000);
});
```
