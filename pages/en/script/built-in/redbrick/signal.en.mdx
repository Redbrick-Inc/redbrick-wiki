# Signal

> Module for inter-script communication.

Class used for communication between client scripts or server scripts. Signals can be used to run functions that exist in different scripts, and so on.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You must use the Event Manager module for signaling between client and server
  scripts.
</Callout>
## Methods

### send(name, params)

Sends a signal with the name corresponding to the name. The signal is passed throughout the client script or throughout the server script. You can pass the parameters with the params option.

### addListener(name, callback)

Registers the function to run when a signal corresponding to name is received. If there are any parameters sent at the time of sending, receive them and deliver them to the callback function.

### removeListener(name, callback)

If you have a specific function registered for the signal that corresponds to the name, remove it from the list of registered functions.

### Example

- ObjectA

```js copy
// This Object listens signal
function Start() {
  REDBRICK.Signal.addListener("MOVE", (params) => {
    this.move(params.x, params.y, params.z, params.duration);
  });
}
```

- ObjectB

```js copy
// This Object sends signal
function OnKeyDown(event) {
  if (event.code === "KeyM") {
    REDBRICK.Signal.send("MOVE", { x: 0, y: 1, z: 0, duration: 1 });
  }
}
```
