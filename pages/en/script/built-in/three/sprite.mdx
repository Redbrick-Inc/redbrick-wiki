<Callout type="info">
These are the elements used inside the Studio for GUI, Particles, etc. Sprites also inherit from Object3D, so they can use the properties and functions that exist in [THREE.Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=object#api/en/core/Object3D) and [THREE.Object3D.Sprite](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=sprite#api/en/objects/Sprite) in addition to those described below.
