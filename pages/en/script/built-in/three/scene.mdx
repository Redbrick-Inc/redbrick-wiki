# Scene

> This class corresponds to a space where you can place 3D objects, lights, cameras, and other elements.

<Callout type="info">
    The Scene also inherits from Object3D, so in addition to the properties and functions described below, you can also use the properties and functions that exist in [THREE.Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=object#api/en/core/Object3D) and [THREE.Object3D.Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=scene#api/en/scenes/Scene).
