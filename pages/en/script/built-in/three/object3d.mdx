# Object3D

> This is the class that most objects in 3D space inherit from.

## Properties

`.children` : Array

Array with object's children. See Group for info on manually grouping objects.

`.parent` : Object3D

Object's parent in the scene graph. An object can have at most one parent.

`.castShadow` : Boolean

Whether the object gets rendered into shadow map. Default is false.

`.receiveShadow` : Boolean

Whether the material receives shadows. Default is false.

`.position` : Vector3

A Vector3 representing the object's local position. Default is `(0, 0, 0)`.

`.rotation` : Euler

Object's local rotation (see Euler angles), in radians.

`.scale` : Vector3

The object's local scale. Default is Vector3( 1, 1, 1 ).

`.quaternion` : Quaternion

Object's local rotation as a Quaternion.

`.visible` : Boolean

Object gets rendered if true. Default is true.

## Methods

`.add ( object : Object3D, ... )` : this

Adds object as child of this object. An arbitrary number of objects may be added. Any current parent on an object passed in here will be removed, since an object can have at most one parent.

`.attach ( object : Object3D )` : this

Adds object as a child of this, while maintaining the object's world transform.

`.remove ( object : Object3D, ... ) `: this

Removes object as child of this object. An arbitrary number of objects may be removed.

`.removeFromParent ()` : this

Removes this object from its current parent.

`.clone ( recursive : Boolean )` : Object3D

recursive -- if true, descendants of the object are also cloned. Default is true.

`.copy ( object : Object3D, recursive : Boolean )` : this

recursive -- if true, descendants of the object are also copied. Default is true.

`.getObjectByProperty ( name : String, value : Any )` : Object3D

name -- the property name to search for.

value -- value of the given property.

`.getObjectById ( id : Integer )` : Object3D

id -- Unique number of the object instance

Searches through an object and its children, starting with the object itself, and returns the first with a matching id.

> Note that ids are assigned in chronological order: 1, 2, 3, ..., incrementing by one for each new object.

`.getWorldPosition ( target : Vector3 )` : Vector3

target — the result will be copied into this Vector3.

`.getWorldQuaternion ( target : Quaternion )` : Quaternion

target — the result will be copied into this Quaternion.

`.getWorldScale ( target : Vector3 )` : Vector3

target — the result will be copied into this Vector3.

`.getWorldDirection ( target : Vector3 )` : Vector3

target — the result will be copied into this Vector3.

`.rotateOnAxis ( axis : Vector3, angle : Float )` : this

axis -- A normalized vector in object space.

angle -- The angle in radians.

`.rotateOnWorldAxis ( axis : Vector3, angle : Float)` : this

axis -- A normalized vector in world space.

angle -- The angle in radians.

`.traverse ( callback : Function )` : undefined

callback - A function with as first argument an object3D object.

`.lookAt ( x : Float, y : Float, z : Float )` : undefined

vector - A vector representing a position in world space.

Optionally, the x, y and z components of the world space position.

Rotates the object to face a point in world space.

This method does not support objects having non-uniformly-scaled parent(s).

`.raycast ( raycaster : Raycaster, intersects : Array )` : undefined

Abstract (empty) method to get intersections between a casted ray and this object. Subclasses such as Mesh, Line, and Points implement this method in order to use raycasting.
