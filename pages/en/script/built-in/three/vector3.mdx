# Vector3

> A 3-dimensional vector class providing various vector operations.

<Callout type="info">
    Besides the information below, you can also utilize various properties and methods of [THREE.Vector3](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=vector3#api/en/math/Vector3).
</Callout>

## Properties

### .x

The x value of the vector. Default is 0.

### .y

The y value of the vector. Default is 0.

### .z

The z value of the vector. Default is 0.

## Methods

### .add()

`origin_vector.add(add_vector: Vector3)`: this

Adds `add_vector` to `origin_vector` and returns the result.  
This method does not modify the original vector itself but returns a new vector.

### .angleTo()

`origin_vector.angleTo(target_vector: Vector3)`: Float

Returns the angle between `origin_vector` and `target_vector` in radians.

### .distanceTo()

`origin_vector.distanceTo(target_vector: Vector3)`: Float

Calculates the distance from `origin_vector` to `target_vector`.

### .clone()

`origin_vector.clone()`: Vector3

Returns a new Vector3 with the same x, y, and z values as `origin_vector`.  
This method does not modify the original vector but returns a cloned vector as a new object.

### .copy()

`origin_vector.copy(target_vector: Vector3)`: this

Copies the x, y, and z properties from `target_vector` to `origin_vector` and returns `origin_vector`.  
The values of `origin_vector` are replaced with those of `target_vector`.

### .length()

`target_vector.length()`: Float

Calculates the Euclidean length (straight-line distance) from (0, 0, 0) to `target_vector` (x, y, z).

### .multiplyScalar()

`origin_vector.multiplyScalar(s: Float)`: this

Multiplies `origin_vector` by a scalar `s`.  
This method does not modify the original vector itself but returns a new vector with each component multiplied by the scalar value.

### .normalize()

`origin_vector.normalize()`: this

Normalizes the current vector to a unit vector.  
Normalization means setting the length of the vector to 1 while retaining its direction.  
This method modifies `origin_vector` and returns the normalized unit vector.

### .set()

`origin_vector.set(x: Float, y: Float, z: Float)`: this

Sets the x, y, and z components of the vector.  
This method modifies `origin_vector` and returns the modified vector itself.
