<Callout type="info">
    Besides the information below, you can also utilize various properties and methods of [THREE.Texture](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=texture#api/en/textures/Texture).
</Callout>

## Properties

### .offset

`.offset` : Vector2

How much a single repetition of the texture is offset from the beginning, in each direction U and V. Typical range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### .repeat

`.repeat`: Vector2

How many times the texture is repeated across the surface, in each direction U and V. If repeat is set greater than 1 in either direction, the corresponding Wrap parameter should also be set to THREE.RepeatWrapping or THREE.MirroredRepeatWrapping to achieve the desired tiling effect.

### .rotation

`.rotation`: number

How much the texture is rotated around the center point, in radians. Positive values are counter-clockwise. Default is 0.

### .center

`.center`: Vector2

The point around which rotation occurs. A value of (0.5, 0.5) corresponds to the center of the texture. Default is (0, 0), the lower left.
