## Properties

### .opacity

`.opacity` : Float

Float in the range of 0.0 - 1.0 indicating how transparent the material is.  
A value of 0.0 indicates fully transparent, 1.0 is fully opaque.  
If the material's transparent property is not set to true, the material will remain fully opaque and this value will only affect its color.  
Default is 1.0.

### .transparent

`.transparent` : Boolean

Defines whether this material is transparent. This has an effect on rendering as transparent objects need special treatment and are rendered after non-transparent objects.  
When set to true, the extent to which the material is transparent is controlled by setting its opacity property.  
Default is false.

### .side

`.side` : Integer

Defines which side of faces will be rendered - front, back or both.  
Default is THREE.FrontSide. Other options are THREE.BackSide or THREE.DoubleSide.
