# Client Script & Server Script

> Provides information about client and server scripts.

Client Script runs on individual player's clients, and Server Script runs on a multiplayer server. If you don't create it in multiplayer, you don't need to write Server Script, you just write Client Script.
As the roles of Client Script and Server Script are different, there are also differences in the Event Function or Global Object that can be used within the script.

Server scripts are shown in red and client scripts are shown in blue, as depicted in the image below.
