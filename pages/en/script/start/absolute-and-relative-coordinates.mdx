# Absolute and Relative Coordinates

> This guide explains the concepts and usage of absolute and relative coordinates.

## Absolute Coordinates

Absolute coordinates represent a fixed position relative to a specific reference point (the world).  
These coordinates indicate a specific position in the global coordinate system, and this position does not change, remaining independent of other objects' positions.  

Example: Moving to the position (100, 50, 200) in the world coordinate system.

Here’s how to adjust an object's position based on absolute coordinates in Redbrick Studio.  

### Object.position.set()

You can use [`Object.position.set(x, y, z)`](../built-in/three/vector3#set) to instantly move an object to a specific position within the world.  

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position.set()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");
const obj2 = WORLD.getObject("obj2");

obj.position.set(10, 10, 10); // Move the object to coordinates x=10, y=10, z=10
obj.position.set(PLAYER.position.x, PLAYER.position.y, PLAYER.position.z); // Move the object to the player's position
PLAYER.position.set(obj2.position.x, obj2.position.y, obj2.position.z); // Move the player to obj2's position

PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true; // This code needs to be executed after changing the position of the PLAYER or any object with an active Physics Body property to reflect the change
```

### Directly Updating the position Value

You can also access the [`.position`](../built-in/three/object3d#position) property directly to update the value without using the `.set()` method.  

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position_value_update"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");

obj.position.x = 10; // Move the object to x=10 while keeping y and z coordinates the same
obj.position.z = PLAYER.position.z; // Set the object's z coordinate to match the player's z coordinate
PLAYER.position.y = 100; // Change the player's height to 100

PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true; // This code needs to be executed after changing the position of the PLAYER or any object with an active Physics Body property to reflect the change
```

### PLAYER.spawn()

If the object you want to move is the player avatar, you can use the [`.spawn(target)`](../api/avatar#spawn) method.  
If you do not provide the target parameter, the player will move to the position of the `starting_point` asset (if it exists in the scene).  

```js copy showLineNumbers filename=".spawn()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("object");

PLAYER.spawn(); // Move to the starting_point if no parameter is provided
PLAYER.spawn(obj); // Move to obj's position
PLAYER.spawn("object"); // Move to obj's position (specified by its title)
```

## Relative Coordinates

Relative coordinates represent a position relative to the current position or a specific reference point.  
These coordinates change based on the reference point's position and are expressed in terms of movement direction and distance.  

Example:  
Moving 10 units along the x-axis and 5 units along the y-axis from the current position.  
Moving a specific distance relative to a certain object.  

Here’s how to adjust an object's position based on relative coordinates in Redbrick Studio.  

### Object.position.set()

You can implement relative movement by using the [`Object.position.set(x, y, z)`](../built-in/three/vector3#set) method as follows:  

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position.set()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");
const obj2 = WORLD.getObject("obj2");

obj.position.set(obj2.position.x + 10, obj2.position.y, obj2.position.z); // Move obj 10 units along the x-axis from obj2's position
PLAYER.position.set(obj2.position.x, obj2.position.y + 10, obj2.position.z); // Move the player 10 units along the y-axis from obj2's position

PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true; // This code needs to be executed after changing the position of the PLAYER or any object with an active Physics Body property to reflect the change
```

### Directly Updating the position Value

You can also access the [`.position`](../built-in/three/object3d#position) property directly to update the value for relative movement.  

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position_value_update"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");

obj.position.x += 10; // Move the object 10 units from its current x coordinate (keeping y and z the same)
obj.position.z = PLAYER.position.z - 10; // Move the object to the player's z coordinate minus 10 units (keeping x and y the same)
PLAYER.position.y += 10; // Increase the player's height by 10 units from its current height

PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true; // This code needs to be executed after changing the position of the PLAYER or any object with an active Physics Body property to reflect the change
```

### Object.go()

You can use the [`Object.go()`](../api/object3d#go) method to move a specific distance from the current position.  

```js copy showLineNumbers filename=".go()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");

obj.go(0, 5, 0); // Move the object 5 units up from its current height
PLAYER.go(5, 5, 5); // Move the player 5 units along the x, y, and z axes from the current position
```

### Object.move()

You can use the [`Object.move()`](../api/object3d#move) method to move an object over a specified time duration relative to its current position.  

```js copy showLineNumbers filename=".move()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");

obj.move(10, 0, 10, 5); // Move the object 10 units along the x and z axes over 5 seconds from its current position
PLAYER.move(0, 5, 0, 10); // Move the player 5 units up over 10 seconds from its current height
```
