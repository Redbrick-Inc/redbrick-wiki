# Absolute and Relative Coordinates

> This guide explains the concepts and usage of absolute and relative coordinates.

<Callout type="warning">
    For PLAYER objects or objects with the Physics Body property enabled, you need to run the code `Object.body.needUpdate = true;` after using [`.position.set()`](../built-in/three/vector3#set) or updating the [`.position`](../built-in/three/object3d#position) property to apply the position change.

## Moving with Absolute Coordinates

Absolute coordinates represent a fixed position relative to a specific reference point (the world).  
These coordinates point to a specific location in the global coordinate system, independent of other objects' positions.

Example: Moving to the position (100, 50, 200) in the world coordinate system.

In Redbrick Studio, you can adjust the position of an object based on absolute coordinates as follows:

### Object.position.set()

Using [`Object.position.set(x, y, z)`](../built-in/three/vector3#set), you can instantly move an object to a specific coordinate within the world.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position.set()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");
const obj2 = WORLD.getObject("obj2");

obj.position.set(10, 10, 10); //Move object to coordinates x=10, y=10, z=10
obj.position.set(PLAYER.position.x, PLAYER.position.y, PLAYER.position.z); //Move object to the player's position
PLAYER.position.set(obj2.position.x, obj2.position.y, obj2.position.z) //Move player to obj2's position

//For PLAYER objects or objects with the Physics Body property enabled, run the code below after changing position to apply the change
PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true; 
obj.body.needUpdate = true;
```

### Object.position.copy()

Besides using `position.set()`, you can use [`Object.position.copy(vector)`](../built-in/three/vector3#copy) to immediately move an object to a specific position in the world.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position.copy()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");
const obj2 = WORLD.getObject("obj2");

obj.position.copy(obj2.position); // Move obj to obj2's position
obj2.position.copy(PLAYER.position); // Move obj2 to the player's position
PLAYER.position.copy(obj.position); // Move the player to obj's position

// For PLAYER objects or objects with the Physics Body property enabled,
// execute the following code after changing the position to apply the update
PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true; 
obj.body.needUpdate = true;
```

### Directly Updating position Values

Instead of using the `.set()` method, you can directly update the values of the [`.position`](../built-in/three/object3d#position) property.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position_value_update"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");
const obj2 = WORLD.getObject("obj2");

obj.position.x = 10; //Move the object to x=10 while keeping the current y, z coordinates
obj2.position.z = PLAYER.position.z; //Set the object's z coordinate to the player's z coordinate
PLAYER.position.y = 100; //Change the player's height (y) to 100

//For PLAYER objects or objects with the Physics Body property enabled, run the code below after changing position to apply the change
PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true;
obj.body.needUpdate = true;
```

### PLAYER.spawn()

If the object you want to move is the player avatar, you can use the [`.spawn(target)`](../api/avatar#spawn) method.  
If you do not provide a target parameter, it will move to the location of the `starting_point` asset (if it exists in the scene).

```js copy showLineNumbers filename=".spawn()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("object");

PLAYER.spawn(); //Move to starting_point if no parameter is provided
PLAYER.spawn(obj); //Move to obj's location
PLAYER.spawn("object"); //Move to obj's location (specified by title)
```

## Moving with Relative Coordinates

Relative coordinates represent a position relative to the current location or a specific reference point.  
They change based on the reference point's location and are expressed in terms of direction and distance.

Example:  
Moving 10 units along the x-axis and 5 units along the y-axis from the current position.  
Moving a specific distance relative to another object.

In Redbrick Studio, you can adjust the position of an object based on relative coordinates as follows:

### Object.position.set()

You can implement relative movement using the [`Object.position.set(x, y, z)`](../built-in/three/vector3#set) method as follows:

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position.set()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");
const obj2 = WORLD.getObject("obj2");

obj.position.set(obj2.position.x + 10, obj2.position.y, obj2.position.z); //Move obj by x+10 relative to obj2's position
PLAYER.position.set(obj2.position.x, obj2.position.y + 10, obj2.position.z) //Move player by y+10 relative to obj2's position

//For PLAYER objects or objects with the Physics Body property enabled, run the code below after changing position to apply the change
PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true;
obj.body.needUpdate = true;
```

### Directly Updating position Values

You can implement relative movement by directly updating the values of the [`.position`](../built-in/three/object3d#position) property.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="position_value_update"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");
const obj2 = WORLD.getObject("obj2");

obj.position.x += 10; //Move the object by x+10 from the current position (keeping y, z coordinates the same)
obj2.position.z = PLAYER.position.z - 10; //Move the object to z-10 from the player's position (keeping x, y coordinates the same)
PLAYER.position.y += 10; //Increase the player's height (y) by 10 from the current height

//For PLAYER objects or objects with the Physics Body property enabled, run the code below after changing position to apply the change
PLAYER.body.needUpdate = true;
obj.body.needUpdate = true;
```

### Object.go()

Using the [`Object.go()`](../api/object3d#go) method, you can move an object by a certain distance from the current position.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename=".go()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");

obj.go(0, 5, 0); //Move the object up by 5 units from the current height (y)
PLAYER.go(5, 5, 5); //Move the player by 5 units along x, y, z from the current position
```

### Object.move()

Using the [`Object.move()`](../api/object3d#move) method, you can make an object move over a specified time based on the current position.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename=".go()"
const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");

obj.move(10, 0, 10, 5); //Move the object by x+10, z+10 from the current position over 5 seconds
PLAYER.go(0, 5, 0, 10); //Move the player up by 5 units (y) from the current position over 10 seconds
```
