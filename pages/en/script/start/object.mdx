# Object Script

> Provides basic instructions for adding and using object scripts.

In creating a single-player game, the scripts you will use can be categorized into two types: object scripts and scene scripts.  
An object script refers to a script that is attached directly to an object itself.  

You can **add/edit/delete** object scripts from the Properties panel of the object. You can also rename the script.

If you use scene scripts instead of object scripts, you need to explicitly specify which object to reference using methods like `getObject()`. 

```js showLineNumbers filename="Scene Script"
const score_board = GUI.getObject("score_board"); // You need to explicitly specify which object to reference
score_board.setText("100");
```

However, if you use object scripts, you can directly access the object to which the script is attached using the `this` keyword within the script.

```js showLineNumbers copy {2} filename="Object Script for GUI Object score_board"
this.setText("100"); // You can directly access the object using 'this'
```

You can view the list of all scripts by clicking the button in the top left menu, as shown in the image below.
