# Object & Scene Scripts

> This guide explains object scripts and scene scripts.

If you are creating a single-player game, you will only use client scripts.  
Client scripts are divided into object scripts and scene scripts.  
These are scripts connected to objects and scenes, respectively.  

If you use scene scripts instead of object scripts, you must specify which object to retrieve using methods like `getObject()`

```js showLineNumbers filename="Scene Script"
const score_board = GUI.getObject("score_board"); // You must directly specify which object to retrieve
score_board.setText("100");
```

However, if you use object scripts, you can directly access the object where the script is written using the this keyword.

```js showLineNumbers copy {2} filename="Object script of score_board GUI"
this.setText("100"); // Use 'this' to directly access the object
```

Scene scripts typically handle initialization, settings, interactions, and event processing for the scene.
For example, they are used to place specific objects when a scene starts or to detect and handle events occurring within the scene.
