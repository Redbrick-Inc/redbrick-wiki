# Object3D

> This API is added to all objects except Scene and Sprite.

## Methods

### go(dx, dy, dz)

The object moves immediately.

- dx : Distance in x direction.

- dy : Distance in y direction.

- dz : Distance in z direction.

### move(dx, dy, dz, duration)

The object moves over the specified time. Internally uses TWEEN.

- dx : Distance in x direction.

- dy : Distance in y direction.

- dz : Distance in z direction.

duration : The time takes to move. Unit is seconds (sec). Default is 1.

### rotate(dx, dy, dz)

The object rotates immediately.

- dx : The angle of rotation around the x-axis. Unit is degrees.

- dy :The angle of rotation around the y-axis. Unit is degrees.

- dz : The angle of rotation around the z-axis. Unit is degrees.

### turn(dx, dy, dz, duration)

The object rotates over the specified time. Internally uses TWEEN.

- dx : The angle of rotation around the x-axis. Unit is degrees.

- dy : The angle of rotation around the y-axis. Unit is degrees.

- dz : The angle of rotation around the z-axis. Unit is degrees.

duration : The time takes to rotate. Unit is seconds (sec). Default is 1.

### onCollide(target, callback, trigger)

Sets the specified function to run when the object collides with the target object. Both this object and the target object must have a body.

- target : The object being collided with or its title.

- callback :The callback function to execute when the target object collides. We recommend using the arrow function to maintain this context.

- trigger : The condition under which a collide event occurs. Default is "start".

  - “start” : Occurs once at the start of a collision.

  - “collision” : Repeatedly occurring during a collision.

  - “end” : Occurs once at the end of a collision.

### setDynamic(boolean)

Changes how the object's movement is controlled. If an object is dynamic, its motion is affected by forces, including gravity, and is determined by a physics engine. If an object is kinematic, it can only move by manually changing its position and rotation through scripting. The object must have body.

- boolean :Change to dynamic if true, kinematic if false.

### applyForce(x, y, z)

Apply a force to an object. The object must have a body and be dynamic.

- x : The amount of force in the x-axis direction.

- y : The amount of force in the y-axis direction.

- z : The amount of force in the z-axis direction.

### kill()

Temporarily removes an object.

### revive()

Recovers an object (that was removed by the kill() method).

### onClick(callback)

Sets the specified callback function to run when the object is clicked.

callback : The callback function to execute when clicked. We recommend using the arrow function to maintain this context.

### getAudio()

Returns the first audio object among the object's children. After adding a sound asset, you can play/stop the audio in the following ways.

```js copy
// Sound Asset​
this.getAudio().stop(); // stop audio
this.getAudio().play(); // play audio
```

For more detailed methods, see [THREE-Audio part](../built-in/three/audio)

### cloneWithMethods()

Clones object with methods listed in this page.
