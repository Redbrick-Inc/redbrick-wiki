# Object3D

> This API is added to all objects except Scene and Sprite.

## Methods

### go()

`.go(dx, dy, dz) `

The object moves immediately.

- dx : Distance in x direction.

- dy : Distance in y direction.

- dz : Distance in z direction.

### move()

`.move(dx, dy, dz, duration) `

The object moves over the specified time. Internally uses TWEEN.

- dx : Distance in x direction.

- dy : Distance in y direction.

- dz : Distance in z direction.

duration : The time takes to move. Unit is seconds (sec). Default is 1.

### rotate()

`.rotate(dx, dy, dz) `

The object rotates immediately.

- dx : The angle of rotation around the x-axis. Unit is degrees.

- dy :The angle of rotation around the y-axis. Unit is degrees.

- dz : The angle of rotation around the z-axis. Unit is degrees.

### turn()

`.turn(dx, dy, dz, duration) `

The object rotates over the specified time. Internally uses TWEEN.

- dx : The angle of rotation around the x-axis. Unit is degrees.

- dy : The angle of rotation around the y-axis. Unit is degrees.

- dz : The angle of rotation around the z-axis. Unit is degrees.

duration : The time takes to rotate. Unit is seconds (sec). Default is 1.

### onCollide()

`.onCollide(target, callback, trigger) `

Sets the specified function to run when the object collides with the target object. Both this object and the target object must have Physics Body activated.

- target : The object being collided with or its title.

- callback :The callback function to execute when the target object collides. We recommend using the arrow function to maintain this context.

- trigger : The condition under which a collide event occurs. Default is "start".

  - “start” : Occurs once at the start of a collision.

  - “collision” : Repeatedly occurring during a collision.

  - “end” : Occurs once at the end of a collision.

### setDynamic()

`.setDynamic(boolean) `

Changes how the object's movement is controlled. If an object is dynamic, its motion is affected by forces, including gravity, and is determined by a physics engine.  
If an object is kinematic, it can only move by manually changing its position and rotation through scripting.  
The object must have Physics Body activated.

- boolean :Change to dynamic if true, kinematic if false.

### applyForce()

`.applyForce(x, y, z) `

Apply a force to an object. The object must have Physics Body activated and be dynamic.

- x : The amount of force in the x-axis direction.

- y : The amount of force in the y-axis direction.

- z : The amount of force in the z-axis direction.

### kill()

Temporarily removes an object.

### revive()

Recovers an object (that was removed by the kill() method).

### onClick()

`.onClick(callback) `

Sets the specified callback function to run when the object is clicked.

callback : The callback function to execute when clicked. We recommend using the arrow function to maintain this context.

### getAudio()

Returns the first audio object among the object's children. After adding a sound asset, you can play/stop the audio in the following ways.

```js copy
// Sound Asset​
this.getAudio().stop(); // stop audio
this.getAudio().play(); // play audio
```

For more detailed methods, see [THREE-Audio part](../built-in/three/audio)

### cloneWithMethods()

Copy the remaining properties of the object excluding its Behavior and Physics attributes to create a new object.  
The duplicated object can utilize properties and methods listed in [THREE.Object3D](../built-in/three/object3d) and on the [current page](#).  
(However, Physics attributes are not copied, so `.onCollide()` cannot be used.)  

<Callout type="warning">
    The cloned object must be added as a child to the WORLD in order to be used.
    ```js showLineNumbers copy filename="EX"
    const obj = WORLD.getObject("obj");
    const clone_obj = obj.cloneWithMethods();
    WORLD.add(clone_obj);
    clone_obj.position.set(10, 1, 10);
    ```
