# Avatar

> API that is added to the player's avatar.

The player (avatar) object also inherits from Object3D, so it can use the properties and methods of [Object3D](../built-in/three/object3d.mdx).

## Methods

### .spawn()

`.spawn(target) `

- target : object or the title of the object. Spawn to the location of that object. Defaulte is StartLocation.

The avatar moves to the location you specify.  
If no target is specified, you will move to `starting_point`.

<Callout type="warning">
To move to `starting_point`, the `starting_point` asset must exist within the scene.
