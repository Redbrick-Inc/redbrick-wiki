# Layer

## Select Object / GUI

You can select an object by clicking on it.

## Show & Hide Object / GUI

## Reorder Object / GUI

You can change the order of objects / GUIs by dragging them on the Asset layer and moving them to the desired location.

For objects, the order is meaningless, but for GUIs, the bottommost GUI will be the most visible on the screen and will be selected first when clicked.

By dragging and moving specific objects / GUIs on an asset layer, it is possible to include objects or GUIs as children of other elements or separate them from their parents.
