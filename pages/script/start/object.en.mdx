> Provides basic instructions for adding and using object scripts.

You can **add/edit/delete** scripts from the Properties panel of the object. You can also rename the script.

Inside the script, you can use `this{:jsx}` keyword to access the object on which the script was written.

```js showLineNumbers copy {2}
function Start() {
  this.move(1, 1, 1); // this === WORLD.getObject("Cube");
}
```

Click the Script button in the upper-right menu to view a list of all scripts.
