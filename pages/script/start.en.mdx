> Provides guidance on the overall scripting approach.

For each object, you can create and write scripts in the Properties panel.

Scripts are divided into Client Scripts, which run on the client, and Server Scripts, which run on the server.

To help you write scripts, we provide Event Functions, Global Objects, and various APIs.
