# Vector3

> A three-dimensional vector class. It provides various vector operations and more.

## Properties

x - the x value of this vector. Default is 0.

y - the y value of this vector. Default is 0.

z - the z value of this vector. Default is 0.

## Methods

`.add ( v : Vector3 ) `: this

Adds v to this vector.

`.angleTo ( v : Vector3 )` : Float

Returns the angle between this vector and vector v in radians.

`.distanceTo ( v : Vector3 )` : Float

Computes the distance from this vector to v.

`.clone ()` : Vector3

Returns a new vector3 with the same x, y and z values as this one.

`.copy ( v : Vector3 )` : this

Copies the values of the passed vector3's x, y and z properties to this vector3.

`.length ()` : Float

Computes the Euclidean length (straight-line length) from (0, 0, 0) to (x, y, z).

`.multiplyScalar ( s : Float )` : this

Multiplies this vector by scalar s.

`.normalize ()` : this

Convert this vector to a unit vector - that is, sets it equal to a vector with the same direction as this one, but length 1.

`.set ( x : Float, y : Float, z : Float )` : this

Sets the x, y and z components of this vector.
