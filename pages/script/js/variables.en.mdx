# Declare & Assign variables

> Describes how to declare variables in JavaScript.

In order to save the desired object or value, access and utilize the stored value while coding text, you must declare a variable and assign a value.

There are many ways to declare variables in JavaScript, but we recommend using the let, const keywords in Redbrick Studios.

By default, it is declared in the form Keyword `[Variable Name]` and you can assign a value to a variable through the = operator. Assigned values can be accessed by variable names.

```js showLineNumbers /let/ /const/ copy
// variable declaration and assignment
let firstVariable = 1;
const secondVarible = 2;

console.log(firstVariable); // 1
console.log(secondVariable); // 2
```

## let & const

let & const play the same role in that they are keywords that declare variables, but they have the following differences.

- `let`
  - Allows you to assign a new value to variables declared with the keyword let.
  ```js showLineNumbers /let/ copy
  let variable = 1;
  // reassign
  varible = 2;
  console.log(variable); // 2
  ```
- `const`

  - Variables declared as const cannot be reassigned.

  ```js showLineNumbers /const/ copy
  const variable = 1;
  // reassign
  varible = 2; // Error!
  ```

  - If the assigned value is an array or object, you can change the internal elements of the array/object.

  ```js showLineNumbers /const/ copy
  const object = { title: "red" };
  const array = ["red", "brick"];

  object.title = "brick";
  array[0] = "brick";
  array[1] = "red";

  console.log(object); // {title: "brick"}
  console.log(array); // ["brick", "red"]
  ```
